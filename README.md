# Moral judgments for self and others

## About this project

Participants rate their own moral transgressions as morally worse than those committed by others - but only when they are accidental (Cushman & Young, 2011, unpublished data). This project aims to 1. replicate this effect; 2. investigate factors driving this effect; 3. assess functional neural differences during the judgment of first-person versus third-person moral transgressions.

This project lives at the [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/tht5j/). Datasets referenced in this repository's code are available there.
